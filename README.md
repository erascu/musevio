## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erascu/musevio.git
cd musevio
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

If you plan to use the **Harvard Art Museums API**, you'll need to apply for an API key [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkmEBqH76HLMMiCC-GPPnhcvHC9aJS86E32dOd0Z8MpY2rvQ/viewform).</br>
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_HARVARD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you‚Äôre not using the API key yet, this step can be skipped for now.</br>

**Optional: Enable Contact Form Functionality**</br>
If you want the **Contact Form** on the site to actually send messages, you‚Äôll need to provide a POST API endpoint that accepts JSON payloads.

Add the following to your `.env.local`:

```bash
POST_MESSAGE=https://your-api-endpoint.com/api/send
```

The API must accept POST requests with this structure:

```bash
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "message": "Your message here"
}
```

On successful submission, the API should respond with a `200 OK` status.
If you don‚Äôt provide a valid endpoint or use a mock server, form submissions will fail and an error message will be shown to the user.</br>

You can use a custom API like [MockAPI.io](http://mockapi.io/).

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.</br></br>
